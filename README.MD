# scala-startup-template
This project is meant to be a reusable seed for typical client-server application written fully in Scala.

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Motivation
I wanted to create a technology stack that will allow competent Scala developer to create fully blown
application in least possible amount of time. It's not designed for low learning curve, 
but rather for maximizing end productivity.
